# General Coding Guidelines

## Principles

1. **Readability** - Code should be easy to read and understand
2. **Simplicity** - Prefer simple solutions over complex ones
3. **Consistency** - Follow established patterns within the codebase
4. **Documentation** - Document intent, not mechanics
5. **Testing** - All code should be testable and tested

## Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive, intention-revealing names
- Choose meaningful distinctions
- Avoid encodings or type information in names
- Class names should be nouns or noun phrases
- Method names should be verbs or verb phrases

## Formatting

- Use consistent indentation (spaces preferred over tabs)
- Limit line length to 100 characters when possible
- Group related code together
- Separate logical sections with blank lines
- Keep files, classes, and methods small and focused

## Error Handling

- Never ignore exceptions
- Fail fast - detect errors as early as possible
- Provide context with exceptions
- Define exception handling strategies

## Comments

- Comments should explain "why", not "what"
- Update comments when code changes
- Avoid commented-out code
- Use TODO comments for temporary, incomplete, or suboptimal code
